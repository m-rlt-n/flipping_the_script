# flipping_the_script
This repo contains a side-project I used to learn the fundamentals of big data application infrastructure implementation. The application serves 'predictive risk scores' based representing the risk of excessive sentencing faced in a given court case by a given defendant. The model implementation is based on the paper 'Flipping the Script on Criminal Justice Risk Assessment' (Meyer, et al.). The authors of this paper do a much better job articulating the purpose of this model than I would, and their work is linked in the citations section below.
